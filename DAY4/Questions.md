Question 10 — First Non-Repeating Character in a String
(Difficulty: Medium-Beginner → Core interview favorite)

📌 Problem
Write a Java program to find the first non-repeating character in a string.

🧪 Example
Input: "swiss"
Output: w

🎯 What this tests
Frequency logic
Order preservation
Careful thinking (not brute force)

📌 Constraint
No HashMap (arrays or loops only)

🔹 Question 11 — Reverse Words in a Sentence
(Difficulty ↑ — string manipulation)

📌 Problem
Reverse each word, but keep the word order same.

🧪 Example
Input: "Java is powerful"
Output: "avaJ si lufrewop"

🎯 What this tests
String traversal
Nested logic
Control over indexes

🔹 Question 12 — Rotate an Array Left by K Positions
(Difficulty ↑↑ — logic + edge cases)

📌 Problem
Rotate an array left by K positions.

🧪 Example
Input:
Array → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
K → 2
Output:
{3, 4, 5, 1, 2}

⚠️ Constraints
Handle k > array length
No built-in rotate methods

🎯 What this tests
Modulus logic
Array discipline
Interview calmness
